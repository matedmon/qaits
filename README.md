This application needs to import the attached CSV(like Person.csv) file through the interface and save the
details in an database.
The application must allow data to be viewed, edited and deleted from within the interface and
validate all input. The CSV file has some errors in it that are placed there purposefully so be
sure that your application is able to handle this when importing the file.

NB: The "done" button in the editperson file will only work if there are no errors for that particular person. Even the button for sending data to database, it won't work unless there are no more errors in all people's details.
